The constructor should initialize two instance variables: apple_color and apple_quantity. Write a class method called increase that increases the quantity by 1 each time it is invoked. You should also write a str method for this class that returns a string of the format: \"A basket of [quantity goes here] [color goes here] apples.\" e.g. \"A basket of 4 red apples.\" or \"A basket of 50 blue apples.\" (Writing some test code that creates instances and assigns values to variables may help you solve this problem!)"
